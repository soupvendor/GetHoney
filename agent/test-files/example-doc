    The blocks 192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1), 198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2), and 203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3) are provided for use in documentation.

I know I’ve been very guilty of using IP addresses like 1.2.3.4 or 192.168.1.1 when I write example IP addresses; but I had never considered that I might inadvertently write an example that does Something Bad™ when copied and pasted because I picked an IP address that maps to a real, live network. If someone blindly copies and pastes echo "Hi!" | nc 192.168.0.1 8000 that’s one thing that probably won’t do any damage. But on the wrong network, nmap 192.168.0.0/16 might actually get its operator in trouble and so we should write nmap 192.0.2.0/24 as an example that’s guaranteed to be harmless. And savvy readers will understand that it’s an IP or domain just for the sake of example, no strings attached.

For me, it’s an easy choice now. Use example.com for example domain names — if I need multiple domain names, bobross.example.com is perfectly acceptable. And start with 192.0.2.1 for example IP addresses (192 is easy to remember from 192.168.0.0/24 being in rote memory, and then I just have to remember 0.2 after that).

I’ll be careful about example domains and IPs in the future, but I’m not sure that I’ll spend the time to change existing Cloud Foundry test code that uses nonstandard examples. If you’ve wanted to contribute to an open source project but you’ve never known where to start, I would welcome you to make a pull request fixing nonstandard examples in any of our repositories on GitHub or to any other open source project. I can tell you from firsthand experie
